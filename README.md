# Universal React Relay Redux

## Deprecated

I'm no longer maintaining this repository. Please take a look at [cdebotton/react-universal](http://www.github.com/cdebotton/react-universal).

This is not a functional kit yet, too many todos to mention. Some key points are:

- React View Layer
- Redux for managing application state (w/ Redux Devtools, fun~~ <3)
- Relay for managing network interactions
- GraphQL on top of Sequelize for managing the data layer
- koajs for serving the application
- Express with express-graphql for serving the database

Hopefully in the near future we'll be able to implement things like offline persistence through Relay and real time updates through web sockets.

Ultimately, I've been wanting to build a strong Node.js based CMS, and I'm hoping that this scaffold will be the starting point of that.
